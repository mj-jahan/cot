(+) resolved bug for filtering sample from population.
(+) functionality to store into dataframe

MVP would be;
= able to get data, clean and load it
= use TS into graphics libs
= load adjacent currency data for comparison

(+) github functionality
(+) refactored main() for uptodate,
    will be including extract.py refactored over the next update.

need functionality to check on weekly basis and download+append most recent value
